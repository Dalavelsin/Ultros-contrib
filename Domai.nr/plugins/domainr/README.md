Domai.nr
===========

This plugin has sadly been discontinued due to changes in Domainr's API.
Old versions no longer work, so it has been deleted. If you would like to take
it upon yourself to update it, you can find the old code in git history.

The old API is still available, but you are now required to enter a credit card
to get an API key, even for the free tier. I am not comfortable giving those
details unnecessarily, so am ceasing support. We may replace it with a similar
plugin in future if we can find another API as nice as Domainr has been.
