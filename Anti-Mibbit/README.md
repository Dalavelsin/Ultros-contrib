Anti-Mibbit
===========

Some people insist on using terrible IRC clients. This is fine, and generally not your problem.

Mibbit provides an additional two questionable services - a URL shortener and barebones pastebin.
If you're on a corporate or school network, both of these services are pretty likely to be blocked.

This plugin takes links to MibURL and Mibpaste and re-shortens/re-pastebins their targets on
respectable services, and also warns people that insist on using such horrible services.

* As a pastebin, hastebin.com seems like a good choice here.
* URLs will be re-shortened using tinyurl.
