0.0.1: >
    Initial version. The plugin doesn't actually /do/ anything yet, but it's a valid plugin.
    This includes the first versions of the versions.yml and package.yml files.

    This plugin is being used almost as a kind of testbed for the package manager.
0.1.0: >
    Web classes are working, with a default index page and the ability to serve static files.
    This appears to be /FAST/, which is obviously a really good thing. More work needs done on it
    before we can have a proper JSON API, but it''s getting there.
0.1.1: >
    Add a couple API functions to allow adding headers and modifying the navbar.

    Also added automatic asset compilation and merging for .css and .js files.
    This requires a couple of additional modules, "webassets" and "cssmin". As
    usual, the package manager will install these for you.
0.1.2: >
    Display some information on the index page (packages, plugins and protocols),
    could also be used to demonstrate how to access global data from within templates.
0.1.3: >
    Added a function for other plugins to add routes, and some events relating to server
    starting and stopping.
0.1.4: >
    Beginnings of the API and web interface.
0.2.0: >
    Some good progress on the admin interface, as well as a memory usage graph.
0.3.0: >
    A redesigned web interface! Hope everyone likes it!
0.4.0: >
    Another redesign. Templates, eugh. And this one does have some more functionality.
