0.0.1: >
    Initial version. The plugin doesn't actually /do/ anything yet, but it's a valid plugin.
    This includes the first versions of the versions.yml and package.yml files.

    This plugin is being used almost as a kind of testbed for the package manager.
0.1.0: >
    Web classes are working, with a default index page and the ability to serve static files.
    This appears to be /FAST/, which is obviously a really good thing. More work needs done on it
      before we can have a proper JSON API, but it's getting there.
0.1.1: >
    Add a couple API functions to allow adding headers and modifying the navbar.

    Also added automatic asset compilation and merging for .css and .js files.
    This requires a couple of additional modules, "webassets" and "cssmin". As
    usual, the package manager will install these for you.
0.1.2: >
    Display some information on the index page (packages, plugins and protocols),
    could also be used to demonstrate how to access global data from within templates.
